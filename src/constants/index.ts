    mainDescription: "HerLead is not just an agency, it's the last growth partner you'll ever need. When you come to HerLead, you enter a fully integrated 360° ecosystem covering Public Relations, media outreach and monitoring, influencer PR, event publicity, press releases, and reputation and crisis management. You gain end-to-end digital power through social media management, influencer marketing, branded content, SEO, content marketing, and high-performance paid ads across Meta, Google, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. We build brands from the ground up with visual branding, messaging and positioning, brand guidelines, videography, and conversion-focused website design, development, UX/UI strategy, and content structuring. Beyond marketing, we shape people and organizations through leadership and communication training, team culture workshops, personal branding, recruitment solutions, interview preparation, and corporate hiring support. Expect clarity, control, and consistency because once everything works together at this level, there's simply no reason to go anywhere else.",

    founderVision: [
        "HerLead wasn't built in theory; it was built in the trenches. Over a decade of working across branding, hiring, leadership, and digital growth, including high-stakes roles and global exposure with clients in the US, UK, and UAE, taught me what no textbook ever could. I've seen brands with money but no direction, talent without positioning, and marketing without meaning.",
        "As a CHRO, I lived the pressure of real decisions, hiring the wrong people, fixing broken cultures, repairing brand damage, and watching businesses bleed because the fundamentals weren't aligned. HerLead exists because I refused to accept surface-level solutions.",
        "My vision is unapologetic: to build brands and people that are clear, credible, and impossible to ignore. This isn't about trends or tactics, it's about doing the work right, from the inside out. When you work with HerLead, you don't get guesswork or fluff; you get experience, honesty, and systems forged through real struggle and real results."
