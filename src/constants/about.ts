  founderVision: [
    "HerLead wasn't built in theory; it was built in the trenches. Over a decade of working across branding, hiring, leadership, and digital growth, including high-stakes roles and global exposure with clients in the US, UK, and UAE, taught me what no textbook ever could. I've seen brands with money but no direction, talent without positioning, and marketing without meaning.",
    "As a CHRO, I lived the pressure of real decisions, hiring the wrong people, fixing broken cultures, repairing brand damage, and watching businesses bleed because the fundamentals weren't aligned. HerLead exists because I refused to accept surface-level solutions.",
    "My vision is unapologetic: to build brands and people that are clear, credible, and impossible to ignore. This isn't about trends or tactics, it's about doing the work right, from the inside out. When you work with HerLead, you don't get guesswork or fluff; you get experience, honesty, and systems forged through real struggle and real results."
