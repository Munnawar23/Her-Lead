    founderVision: [
        "<strong>HerLead</strong> was built through real work, not ideas on paper. Years of experience in branding, hiring, leadership, and business growth, working with clients in the US, UK, and UAE—showed me one clear truth: businesses fail when the basics are misaligned.",
        "As a <strong>Chief Human Resources Officer</strong>, I’ve made tough decisions, seen the cost of wrong hires and weak cultures, and fixed problems that hurt both people and brands. HerLead exists to do the work properly, not to offer quick fixes.",
        "We build brands and leaders with clarity, credibility, and purpose. No noise. No shortcuts. Just honest work that delivers results."
